## Comment tags
For convenience and practicity, at least until "release 1", the code may contain the following comment tags:  
- #TODO: something to be done
- #techdebt: something that needs to be refactored
- #review: pull-request review comment, or something that needs to be discussed

### Method styling

#### Parameters
