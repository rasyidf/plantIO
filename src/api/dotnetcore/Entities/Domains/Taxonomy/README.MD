## Taxonomy

Actual assumptions are:
- one cultivar can be classified according to many "taxonomy classification criterias"
- one cultivar can have different classification data depending on the level of classification practiced for the DataSet

### Taxon
#### [Taxon (plural taxa)](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/taxon)
> (taxonomy) A group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit.

> The word finds its roots in the Greek language œÑŒ¨ŒæŒπœÇ, taxis (meaning 'order', 'arrangement') and ŒΩœåŒºŒøœÇ, nomos ('law' or 'science'). Originally, taxonomy referred only to the classification of organisms or a particular classification of organisms. In a wider, more general sense, it may refer to a classification of things or concepts, as well as to the principles underlying such a classification. Taxonomy is different from meronomy, which is dealing with the classification of parts of a whole.

> The groups of organisms whose names are governed by this code are called taxa (singular: taxon). Taxa may be clades or species, but only clade names are governed by this code.

> In biology, a taxon (plural taxa; back-formation from taxonomy) is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping.

> Initial attempts at classifying and ordering organisms (plants and animals) were set forth in Linnaeus's system in Systema Naturae, 10th edition, (1758)[1] as well as an unpublished work by Bernard and Antoine Laurent de Jussieu. The idea of a unit-based system of biological classification was first made widely available in 1805 in the introduction of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Flore fran√ßoise, of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle's Principes √©l√©mentaires de botanique. Lamarck set out a system for the "natural classification" of plants. Since then, systematists continue to construct accurate classifications encompassing the diversity of life; today, a "good" or "useful" taxon is commonly taken to be one that reflects evolutionary relationships.[note 1]

> Many modern systematists, such as advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature, use cladistic methods that require taxa to be monophyletic (all descendants of some ancestor). Their basic unit, therefore, is the clade rather than the taxon. Similarly, among those contemporary taxonomists working with the traditional Linnean (binomial) nomenclature, few propose taxa they know to be paraphyletic.[2] An example of a well-established taxon that is not also a clade is the class Reptilia, the reptiles; birds are descendants of reptiles but are not included in the Reptilia (birds are included in the Aves).

#### [The meaning of categorical ranks in evolutionary biology](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13127-016-0263-9)
> Despite having been utilized for over 250 years, Linnaean ranks are periodically dismissed by some systematists and evolutionary biologists. Here, we discuss recent criticisms and point out that they are often the result of a misunderstanding of both the meaning and the intent of such ranks. 

>Although arbitrary in some cases, ranks contain meaningful taxonomic information, facilitate communication, and serve as proxies for a fully resolved and correctly dated tree of life. Ranks favor communication and evolutionary comparisons, but they do not make assumptions about equal age or diversity for any two taxa with the same Linnaean category.

#### [Species as Ranked Taxa Systematic Biology, Volume 58, Issue 1, February 2009, Pages 74‚Äì86](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/58/1/74/1676101)
>Because species names play an important role in scientific communication, it is more important that species be understood to be taxa than that they be equated with functional ecological or evolutionary entities. Although most biologists would agree that taxa are composed of organisms that share a unique common history, 2 major challenges remain in developing a species-as-taxa concept. 

>First, grouping: in the face of genealogical discordance at all levels in the taxonomic hierarchy, how can we understand the nature of taxa? 

>Second, ranking: what criteria should be used to designate certain taxa in a nested series as being species? 

>The grouping problem can be solved by viewing taxa as exclusive groups of organisms‚Äî sets of organisms that form a clade for a plurality of the genome (more than any conflicting set). However, no single objective criterion of species rank can be proposed. Instead, the species rank should be assigned by practitioners based on the semisubjective application of a set of species-ranking criteria

#### [The PhyloCode and the Distinction between Taxonomy and Nomenclature](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/55/1/160/2842921)
>Various criticisms of phylogenetic nomenclature and the PhyloCode, including the two just noted by Pickett, result from failing to distinguish between taxonomy and nomenclature. 
 
>Taxonomy is concerned with the representation (and, in a broader sense, also the analysis) of relationships, including (under the common convention of representing relationships using groups) what kinds of groups are to be recognized as taxa. 

>In contrast, nomenclature is concerned with naming taxa as well as with the application of existing taxon names in the context of subsequently proposed taxonomies. 

>In short, taxonomy is concerned with taxa; nomenclature with their names. The two activities, and their corresponding disciplines, are closely related. 
In particular, taxonomies provide a context for coining new names and applying existing ones. 

>Moreover, taxonomy can be considered to include nomenclature to the extent that part of the way in which relationships are represented is with named groups. 

>Nevertheless, nomenclature is distinct from a number of exclusively taxonomic concerns, including the kinds of groups that are to be recognized as taxa 
e.g.:
monophyletic
paraphyletic
polyphyletic
>and how their hierarchical relationships are to be represented (e.g., 
with or without categorical ranks). 
 
>This situation should be evident from the fact that a single approach to nomenclature, whether traditional or phylogenetic, can be adopted in the context of different approaches to taxonomy (e.g., gradistic versus cladistic).

>The rejection of nomenclatural types (which should not be confused with typological or essentialist philosophies) was never a fundamental principle of phylogenetic nomenclature (see de Queiroz and Gauthier, 1992:459‚Äì460), and the reason that the PhyloCode does not prohibit the recognition of nonmonophyletic taxa or the use categorical ranks is simply that it is a code of nomenclature rather than of taxonomy. In this paper, I highlight the distinction between taxonomy and nomenclature and use it to explain two of Pickett's misunderstandings about the PhyloCode

>The word ‚ÄúTaxonomy‚Äù is derived from a Greek word ‚Äì ‚Äútaxis‚Äù, meaning arrangement or division, and ‚Äúnomos‚Äù, meaning method.

>Taxonomy is a branch of Biology that refers to the process of classifying different living species. A taxon is referred to as a group of organisms classified as a unit.

>‚ÄúTaxonomic hierarchy is the process of arranging various organisms into successive levels of the biological classification either in a decreasing or an increasing order from kingdom to species and vice versa.‚Äù
